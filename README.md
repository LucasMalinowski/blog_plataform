## Challenge: Building a Mini Blogging Platform

### Description

This is a mini blogging platform that allows users to create, read, update and delete posts. The platform is built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.

The platform has the following features:

1. User Authentication (Devise)
2. Post & Comment CRUD's
3. API Endpoints
   - /api/v1/posts
4. Search with pg_search on Posts title, body and User name
5. Background Job for Sending Notifications once a Post gets a Comment (sidekiq),
6. Dockerized with Docker Compose
7. Deployable to Heroku
8. Tests with RSpec
9. Cache with Redis

Hey team of Bookkeeper360, I hope you enjoy the platform! ðŸš€
I did my best to deliver a clean and well-structured codebase that fullfills the requirements of the challenge.
Really looking forward to hearing your feedback!
Even if I'm not selected, I would love to hear your thoughts on the project.
